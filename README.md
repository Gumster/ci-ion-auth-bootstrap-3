# Codeigniter 2.14 with Ion Auth and Bootstrap 3.0

This is a CI starter app with Ion Auth already added, with views using Bootstrap 3.0 layout and assets. There are some other additions too:
- expanded MIME types in config/mimes.php
- MY_Controller to enforce Ion Auth (use regular CI_Controller for non-restricted areas)
- ENVIRONMENT constant set in index.php is used to determine some config settings (db connection, log level, profiler)
- htaccess file 
- Jamie Rumbelow's MY_Model
